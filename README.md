# Analytics

This is a pretty simple plugin that puts the latest Google Analytics javascript in the head section of every page of your forums.

There is another plugin in the list, but I couldn't get it to work and it seemed to be using older Analytics code anyway. This one is fresh like Mentos.

It was tested with Vanilla v2.0.6. 

## Installation
This addon is a plugin. You need to extract it to your `/plugins` folder to install it.

Note: In order for this to work for your site, you must change the `$WebId` variable in `default.php` (line 36). The file is well commented and it should be obvious where to change it.
